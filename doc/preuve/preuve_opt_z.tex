\section{Behaviour of the local shortest path}

The path from $a$ to $b$ through $c$ is optimal (the shortest) on each axis, ie if we move $c$ on any axis in any direction, $|\vec{ac}|$ and $|\vec{bc}|$ can be shorten by moving $c$ in the other direction.\\
Let set the center of the orthonormal basis on $c$. Move $a$ on $(ac)$ and $b$ on $(bc)$ in direction of $c$ so that $|\vec{ac}| = |\vec{bc}| = 1$. \\

\subsection{Focus on $z$}
Let $P_a$ be the plane defined by $a$, $c$ and the orthographic projection of $a$ on the plane $xy$. Define $P_b$ similarly. By construction, $P_a$ and $P_b$ respectively contains $[ac]$ and $[bc]$. We now unfold $P_a$ and $P_b$ in a single plane $P$. Due to the optimality of the path on the $z$ axis, $a$, $c$ and $b$ consist on a straight segment.

Consider - on $P$ - the rectangle with $[ab]$ as diagonal. The $z$ axis intersect this rectangle verticaly in the middle and $(ab)$ on $c$. Let $a'$ and $b'$ be the orthographic projections of $a$ and $b$ respectively on $z$ - they belong to $P$ and $z_{a} = z_{a'}$ and $z_{b} = z_{b'}$. We previously said that $|\vec{ac}| = |\vec{bc}|$ and that $a$, $c$ and $b$ are aligned. This implies that both triange $aa'c$ and $bb'c$ have the same dimensions, so $|\vec{a'c}| = |\vec{b'c}|$. Furthermore, $a'$, $c$ and $b'$ are aligned in that order, thus \[z_a = -z_b\]


\section{Local shortest path}

Given two points $a$ and $b$ and an edge $e$, all in the cubical complex, we want to compute the shortest path between $a$ and $b$ passing through $e$. \\

First, compute the visibility of $e$ from $a$ and $b$. It consist of two parts of $e$, let $e_v$ be the intersection of theses partial edges. If $e_v$ doesn't exists, the path from $a$ to $b$ has at least two intermediates vertices. Let $p$ and $q$ be the two end points of $e_v$. If the line segment $[ab]$ cross $e_v$, than the shortest path is direct. Else, the path pass through $p$ or $q$ (this must be proved?).

\begin{verbatim}

LOCAL_OPT(a, b, e):
returns the path from a to b through e if it has one or less intermediate vertices

    e_vis := the part of e visible from both a and b
    if e_vis is empty
        then the path from a to b has more than one intermediate vertices
    else
        p, q := endpoints of e_vis
        if [ab] intersect e_vis:
            then return path (a, b)
        else if dist(ap) + dist(pb) < dist(aq) + dist(qb)
            then return path (a, p, b)
        else
            return path (a, q, b)


\end{verbatim}
